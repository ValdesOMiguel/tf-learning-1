# Terraform Learning

This repo contains my exercises and notes from Terraform course.
The purpose is to learn the use of Terraform as an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool to automate the creation, modification and destruction of resources in the cloud, in this case using **AWS** as a provider.
